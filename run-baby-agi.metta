!(gpt "Patient exhibits multiple risk factors for skin cancer, including excessive sun exposure, fair skin, and a family history of the disease. The patient reports a rapidly growing lesion on their forearm, which has recently changed color and is causing discomfort. Upon examination, the lesion shows asymmetry, irregular borders, and a diameter exceeding 6mm. Given these symptoms and diagnostic criteria, there is a high likelihood of melanoma. Preventive measures, such as consistent sunscreen use, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding tanning beds, are recommended to reduce further risk.")
